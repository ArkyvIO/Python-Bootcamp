# Day 14: "Higher or Lower" Game with Social Media Followers Comparison

## Project Description

The Day 14 project involves the creation of a "Higher or Lower" game in Python, designed to challenge users to guess which of two presented social media accounts has more followers. The game operates by importing data from a separate file that contains information about social media accounts and their follower counts. The game will continue until the user makes an incorrect guess, aiming to teach the process of importing data from an external file for use within a Python program.

## Key Concepts Applied

- **Importing Data from External Files:** Utilizing Python's file-handling capabilities to import data stored in a separate file.
- **Game Logic and User Interaction:** Creating game mechanics that present users with options and require their input for guesses.
- **Social Media Account Comparison:** Comparing follower counts between two social media accounts and prompting users to predict which account has more followers.
- **Looping and Game Termination:** Implementing game loops and conditional statements to control game continuation based on user guesses.

## Project Progress

- [x] Define the structure and objectives of the "Higher or Lower" game with social media followers comparison
- [x] Import follower data from a separate file for use within the game
- [x] Develop game mechanics for presenting account options and obtaining user guesses
- [x] Implement follower count comparison and loop the game until the user makes an incorrect guess
- [x] Complete the "Higher or Lower" game to demonstrate importing data from an external file

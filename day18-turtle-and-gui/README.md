# Day 18: Turtle & The Graphical User Interface (GUI)

## Project Description

The Day 18 project delves into the world of Turtle Graphics and a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in Python. The project aims to cover various aspects, including understanding Turtle Graphics via documentation, drawing geometric shapes, generating random walks, exploring Python tuples for random RGB color generation, creating a spirograph, and the Hirst Painting Project. Topics such as importing modules, installing packages, and using aliases will also be covered.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Turtle Graphics:** Understanding and using Turtle Graphics to draw shapes and patterns.
- **Documentation Exploration:** Utilizing documentation to grasp Turtle Graphics functionalities and methods.
- **Drawing Geometric Shapes:** Drawing squares, dashed lines, and various geometric shapes using Turtle.
- **Random Walk Generation:** Generating a random walk pattern using Turtle.
- **Color Generation:** Utilizing Python tuples to create random RGB colors for drawing shapes.
- **Spirograph Creation:** Implementing Turtle Graphics to create spirograph-like designs.
- **Hirst Painting Project:** Part 1 involves extracting RGB values from images, and Part 2 involves drawing dots as part of the project.
- **Modules, Packages, and Aliases:** Importing modules, installing packages, and working with aliases for efficient code management.

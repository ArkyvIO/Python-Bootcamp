# Day 19: Turtle Games - Instances, State, and Higher-Order Functions

## Project Description

The Day 19 project revolves around Python programming, instances, state, higher-order functions, and Turtle Graphics. The primary focus areas include working with event listeners, creating an Etch-A-Sketch game, utilizing the Turtle coordinate system, and developing a Turtle racing game.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Python Programming:** Exploring instances, state, and higher-order functions in Python.
- **Event Listeners:** Implementing event listeners for user interactions in the game.
- **Etch-A-Sketch Game:** Creating a drawing game using Turtle Graphics.
- **Turtle Coordinate System:** Understanding and utilizing the Turtle coordinate system for game development.
- **Turtle Racing Game:** Developing a game involving Turtle graphics for racing simulations.

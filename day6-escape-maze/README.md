# Day 6: Python Functions Exploration in a Maze Game

## Project Description

The Day 6 project aims to explore, understand, and learn about Python functions in the context of a maze game. The code is to be utilized in a game available at [Reeborg's World](https://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html?lang=en&mode=python&menu=worlds%2Fmenus%2Freeborg_intro_en.json&name=Maze&url=worlds%2Ftutorial_en%2Fmaze1.json), which offers a challenge in programming a robot for navigation through a maze.

## Concepts Explored

- **Understanding Python Functions:** Exploring the concept of functions in Python, their usage, and application within programming.
- **Problem-Solving through Maze Navigation:** Using Python functions to navigate a maze environment and solve challenges within the Reeborg's World platform.

## Project Progress

- [x] Define project objectives
- [x] Set up initial code structure
- [x] Implement basic functionalities for maze navigation

## Code Snippet - Maze Navigation Example

```python
# Maze navigation code snippet
def turn_right():
    for x in range(0, 3):
        turn_left()

while front_is_clear():
    move()

turn_left()

while not at_goal():
    if right_is_clear():
        turn_right()
        move()
    elif front_is_clear():
        move()
    else:
        turn_left()

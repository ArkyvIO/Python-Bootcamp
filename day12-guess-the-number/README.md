# Day 12: Number Guessing Game - Scope and Difficulty Levels

## Project Description

The Day 12 project involves the creation of a number guessing game in Python. This game focuses on the concept of scope while offering two difficulty levels: easy mode and hard mode. The user has to guess a number between 1 and 100, and based on their guesses, the game will provide feedback if the number is too low, too high, or correct. The game sets a limit of turns, allowing the player to play either in easy mode with 10 turns or hard mode with 5 turns.

## Key Concepts Applied

- **Scope in Python:** Understanding and applying the concept of scope within the game's structure and variable management.
- **Difficulty Levels:** Implementing two distinct difficulty levels, each with a different number of allowed turns.
- **User Input and Conditional Statements:** Interacting with user inputs and utilizing conditional statements to determine the game flow based on guesses.
- **Limiting Game Turns:** Setting a limited number of turns based on the selected difficulty level.

## Project Progress

- [x] Define the structure and objectives of the number guessing game
- [x] Implement easy mode with 10 turns for guessing the number
- [x] Develop hard mode with 5 turns for guessing the number
- [x] Incorporate scope management within the game structure
- [x] Complete the number guessing game demonstrating scope concepts

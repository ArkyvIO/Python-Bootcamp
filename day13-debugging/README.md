# Day 13: Learning Debugging Foundations and Extra Exploration

## Project Description

The Day 13 project centers on the foundational understanding of debugging techniques in Python. It involves exploring debugging concepts such as identifying and fixing errors, using breakpoints, stepping into functions, and employing debugging tools provided by Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio Code. Additionally, extra learning beyond the project scope was accomplished by delving into more advanced debugging practices using the aforementioned IDE.

## Key Concepts Explored

- **Debugging Foundations:** Understanding error identification, troubleshooting, and resolving common programming errors.
- **Breakpoints and Stepping Into Functions:** Utilizing breakpoints to pause code execution and stepping into functions for a detailed analysis of code flow.
- **IDE Debugging Tools:** Exploring and leveraging debugging tools provided by IDEs, such as Visual Studio Code, to enhance the debugging process.

## Project Progress

- [x] Learn and apply foundational debugging techniques to identify and fix errors in Python code
- [x] I went beyond the project scope to delve into advanced debugging practices and deepen understanding

No code snippets are provided as the focus of this project is on learning and applying debugging techniques, exploring breakpoints, stepping into functions, and utilizing debugging tools within IDEs.

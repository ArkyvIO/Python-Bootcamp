# Day 4: Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Project Description

For the Day 4 project, I created a Rock Paper Scissors game using Python. This project focused on teaching randomization. The game involves users playing against the computer in a best-of-five series of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

## Concepts Learned

- **Randomization in Python:** Understanding and utilizing the `random` module to generate random integers for game choices.

## Project Progress

- [x] Define project goals
- [x] Set up the game structure
- [x] Implement randomization
- [x] Complete functional Rock Paper Scissors game

## Code Snippet - Random Number Generation Example

```python
import random

# Generate a random number between 1 and 3 for game choices (Rock, Paper, Scissors)
choiceComp = random.randint(1, 3)

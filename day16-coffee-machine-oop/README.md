# Day 16: Object-Oriented Coffee Machine Program with Module Importing

## Project Description

The Day 16 project involves creating a simulated coffee machine program in Python with an emphasis on object-oriented programming (OOP). This program extends the functionalities of the previously developed coffee machine by implementing OOP principles using classes and objects. Additionally, this project introduces the use of external modules like "prettytables" to enhance the program's output for a more visually appealing user experience. To work with project-specific modules, a new virtual environment was created, and project-only modules were installed using pip for Python.

## Key Concepts Applied

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Implementing classes and objects to model coffee machine components and functionalities in a more structured manner.
- **Module Importing:** Importing and utilizing external modules, such as "prettytables," to enhance the program's output and aesthetics.
- **Class Usage:** Accessing and utilizing predefined classes within the program to handle coffee machine functionalities.
- **Virtual Environment Creation:** Setting up a new virtual environment for the project to manage project-specific dependencies and modules.
- **Pip and Module Installation:** Using pip to install project-only modules, ensuring they are isolated within the virtual environment for the project.
